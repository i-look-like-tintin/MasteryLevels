# IT-Project-1
Current Version 6.0.0

<s>(.env file necessary for AI Chat
is stored in MS Teams only)</s>
UPDATE: The AI functionality requires an private key from OpenAI.
As of project handover, this private key will no longer be maintained or available from our team.
You will need to create a new key and an env file to house this in, or otherwise modify the project code if you wish to differently support AI integration.
Any questions, please approach myself.
Cheers, Mackenzie (Technical Lead)
